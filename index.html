                    Our chosen challenge is to design a community space using
                    end of life shipping containers to benefit our local
                    community.

                    Our journey over the course of the design of our solution to this challenge has helped
                    each of us develop and grow in more ways than one. We developed our unique meta skills
                    and personalities while overcoming some of the more challenging aspects of the design 
                    of our solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throught the design of our dolution we found, that our local community suffered from 
                    increasing homelessness and poverty (with Glasgow being shown as 'the homeless capital 
                    of Scotland' by the 'Homelessness in Scotland 24/25 report').            
                </p id = 'crop'>
                <img src="./assets/img/HomelessChart.svg" style="width:50%;aspect-ratio:1/2;margin:auto;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
                <p>
                    Knowing this we set out to find a solution. Eventually we settled on repurposing old 
                    shipping containers as temporary housing for those in financial struggle. Building on 
                    this we came up with he idea to not only house the homeless and destitute, but to give 
                    them the tools to continue living without having the risk of returning to their previous 
                    living conditions. To achieve this we decided to incorporate educational programs and 
                    temporary financial support past an individuals stay in our housing, into our solution.

                    We also decided having security measures to stop disturbances, or the smuggling of 
                    illicit substances would be ideal. Additionaly we added addiction rehabiliation to 
                    our list of support programs.
